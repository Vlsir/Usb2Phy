# USB 2.0 High-Speed PHY

480 Mbps USB 2.0 Transceiver in the SkyWater 130nm Technology

- [Usb2PhyAna](./Usb2PhyAna/) contains the Python and [Hdl21](https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Hdl21) based PHY custom/ analog design
- [Usb2PhyDig](./Usb2PhyDig/) contains the PHY digital logic
- [Usb2Phy](./Usb2Phy/) contains the structural PHY top-level design and interfaces between the two

## Work in Progress Beware!
