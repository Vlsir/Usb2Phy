# USB 2.0 High-Speed PHY

480 Mbps USB 2.0 Transceiver in the SkyWater 130nm Technology 

## (Lots More Actual Docs Here)

--- 

## Development 

* [Usb2PhyAna](./Usb2PhyAna/) contains the Python and [Hdl21](https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Hdl21) based PHY custom/ analog design 
* [Usb2PhyDig](./Usb2PhyDig/) contains the (System(?))(Verilog(?)) based PHY digital logic 
* [Usb2Phy](./Usb2Phy/) contains the structural PHY top-level design and interfaces between the two 
* (Maybe another thing for "chip" or similar, if we want embedable "IP" vs discrete-"chip" versions)
